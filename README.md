##DESCRIPTION ## :
1. **Load the Dataset:**  
   - Import and inspect the dataset (e.g., using Pandas).  

2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.  
   - Convert categorical data into numerical format if needed.  

3. **Feature Selection & Engineering:**

4. **Split the Data:**  
   - Divide the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% train, 20% test).  

5. **Train a Machine Learning Model:** 
   - Choose a model (e.g., Linear Regression for regression, Decision Tree/Logistic Regression for classification).  
   - Train the model using the training data.  

6. **Evaluate the Model:**  
   - Test the model on unseen data.  
   - Use performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall (for classification) or RMSE, RÂ² (for regression).  

7. **Interpret Results & Conclusion:**  
   - Analyze model performance and key findings.  

8. **Deliverable Creation:**  
   - Document the steps in a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb).  
   - Include code, visualizations, and explanations.
